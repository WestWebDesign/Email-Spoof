# Email Spoofing
<hr>
<p>This paper is going to explain how one would create an email spoof to confuse or gain access to someoneâ€™s information. We are going to create a fictional company called ABC Company and we are going to explain how this would be done. What is email spoofing? Email spoofing basically comes from sending emails with a false sender address. Pretending to be someone else can have its advantages especially if that someone else holds a position of power or trust with regards to the receiver.</p>
<p>
First, we need to set up a relay server to send the spoofed emails. A relay server is an Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), mail servers use SMTP to send and receive messages. All major companies use SMTP when sending too or receiving email outside of internal systems. In order to defeat spoofed emails, you must use a SMTP server that is authorized. If you are using a non-authorized server companies like Google and Yahoo will reject all emails sent. </p>

How to find a relay server? We need to find a free web host that has a mail feature. Most web hosting servers are a trusted server so we can then setup our spoofed email account. Most all web hosting servers will have a mail feature if you pay for the service. </p>
